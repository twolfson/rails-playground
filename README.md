Playground environment for Ruby on Rails

## Getting started
Before getting our repo set up, please verify the following dependencies are installed:

- Ruby >= 2.2.1
    - We recommend using [chruby][] and [ruby-install][] to avoid interfering with your OS' Ruby
    - Alternatively, a Docker container would alleviate these issues as well
- Bundler (`gem install bundler`)

[chruby]: https://github.com/postmodern/chruby
[ruby-install]: https://github.com/postmodern/ruby-install

To get our repo set up locally, run the following:

```bash
# Clone our repository
git clone git@github.com:twolfson/rails-playground.git
cd rails-playground

# Install our local files
bundle install

# TODO: Define server startup
